# Trust list for claude-code-templates

# This project uses permissive mode (require-vouch=false):
# everyone can open PRs EXCEPT denounced users.
#
# Maintainers can denounce bad actors by commenting on any issue:
#   denounce @username <reason>
#
# To unblock someone:
#   unvouch @username
#
# Syntax:
#  - One handle per line (without @). Sorted alphabetically.
#  - Denounce a user with minus prefix: `-username` or `-platform:username`.
#  - Optionally, add details after a space following the handle.
#
# See https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch for the full specification.
