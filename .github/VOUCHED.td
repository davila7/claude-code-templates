# Vouched contributors for claude-code-templates
#
# Only vouched users can contribute to this project.
# Denounced users are explicitly blocked.
#
# Maintainers can vouch for new contributors by commenting "vouch" on
# an issue by the author. Maintainers can denounce users by commenting
# "denounce" or "denounce @username" on an issue or PR.
#
# Syntax:
#  - One handle per line (without @). Sorted alphabetically.
#  - Optionally specify platform: `platform:username` (e.g., `github:user`).
#  - To denounce a user, prefix with minus: `-username` or `-platform:username`.
#  - Optionally, add details after a space following the handle.
