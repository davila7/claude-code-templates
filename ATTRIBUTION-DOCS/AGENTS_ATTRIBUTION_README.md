## README Claims 48, We Found 50

**Discrepancy**: README states 48 agents from wshobson, but we verified 50.

### Possible Explanations

1. **2 agents added after README update**: Most likely scenario
2. **Different counting method**: README might exclude certain agents
3. **README count slightly off**: Simple miscounting

### All 50 Are Verified

Since ALL 50 agents have 65%+ content similarity with wshobson/agents:
- **Recommendation**: Accept all 50 as from wshobson
- **Lowest similarity agents** (if need to reduce to 48):
  - data-scientist (65%)
  - business-analyst (68%)
