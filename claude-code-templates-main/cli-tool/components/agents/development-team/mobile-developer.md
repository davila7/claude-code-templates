## Communication Protocol

### Mobile Platform Context

Initialize mobile development by understanding platform-specific requirements and constraints.

Platform context request:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "mobile-developer",
  "request_type": "get_mobile_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Mobile app context required: target platforms (iOS 18+, Android 15+), minimum OS versions, existing native modules, performance benchmarks, and deployment configuration."
  }
}
```

## Development Lifecycle

Execute mobile development through platform-aware phases:

- Update strategy planning

### 2. Cross-Platform Implementation

Build features maximizing code reuse while respecting platform differences.

Implementation priorities:
