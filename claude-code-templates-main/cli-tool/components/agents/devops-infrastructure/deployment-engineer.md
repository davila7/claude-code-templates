## Communication Protocol

### Deployment Assessment

Initialize deployment engineering by understanding current state and goals.

Deployment context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "deployment-engineer",
  "request_type": "get_deployment_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Deployment context needed: application architecture, deployment frequency, current tools, pain points, compliance requirements, and team structure."
  }
}
```
