# Google Workspace Events

Execute Google Workspace Events operations: $ARGUMENTS

## Prerequisites

- Google Workspace CLI (`gws`) must be installed
- Authentication configured: Run `gws auth status` to verify
- Review `gws events --help` for all available commands

## Available Resources and Methods

# events (v1)

> **PREREQUISITE:** Read `../gws-shared/SKILL.md` for auth, global flags, and security rules. If missing, run `gws generate-skills` to create it.

```bash
gws events <resource> <method> [flags]
```

## Helper Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [`+subscribe`](../gws-events-subscribe/SKILL.md) | Subscribe to Workspace events and stream them as NDJSON |
| [`+renew`](../gws-events-renew/SKILL.md) | Renew/reactivate Workspace Events subscriptions |

## API Resources

### message

  - `stream` — SendStreamingMessage is a streaming call that will return a stream of task update events until the Task is in an interrupted or terminal state.

### operations

  - `get` — Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.

### subscriptions

  - `create` — Creates a Google Workspace subscription. To learn how to use this method, see [Create a Google Workspace subscription](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides/create-subscription).
  - `delete` — Deletes a Google Workspace subscription. To learn how to use this method, see [Delete a Google Workspace subscription](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides/delete-subscription).
  - `get` — Gets details about a Google Workspace subscription. To learn how to use this method, see [Get details about a Google Workspace subscription](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides/get-subscription).
  - `list` — Lists Google Workspace subscriptions. To learn how to use this method, see [List Google Workspace subscriptions](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides/list-subscriptions).
  - `patch` — Updates or renews a Google Workspace subscription. To learn how to use this method, see [Update or renew a Google Workspace subscription](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides/update-subscription).
  - `reactivate` — Reactivates a suspended Google Workspace subscription. This method resets your subscription's `State` field to `ACTIVE`. Before you use this method, you must fix the error that suspended the subscription. This method will ignore or reject any subscription that isn't currently in a suspended state. To learn how to use this method, see [Reactivate a Google Workspace subscription](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides/reactivate-subscription).

### tasks

  - `cancel` — Cancel a task from the agent. If supported one should expect no more task updates for the task.
  - `get` — Get the current state of a task from the agent.
  - `subscribe` — TaskSubscription is a streaming call that will return a stream of task update events. This attaches the stream to an existing in process task. If the task is complete the stream will return the completed task (like GetTask) and close the stream.
  - `pushNotificationConfigs` — Operations on the 'pushNotificationConfigs' resource

## Discovering Commands

Before calling any API method, inspect it:

```bash
# Browse resources and methods
gws events --help

# Inspect a method's required params, types, and defaults
gws schema events.<resource>.<method>
```

Use `gws schema` output to build your `--params` and `--json` flags.

## Usage

```bash
# List available resources and methods
gws events --help

# Inspect method schema before calling
gws schema events.<resource>.<method>

# Execute command with arguments
gws events $ARGUMENTS
```

## Task

Execute the requested Events operation: $ARGUMENTS

1. **Verify Prerequisites**
   - Check `gws` is installed: `gws --version`
   - Verify authentication: `gws auth status`
   - Review available commands: `gws events --help`

2. **Inspect Method Schema**
   - Before calling any method, inspect its parameters
   - Use `gws schema` to understand required fields
   - Review parameter types and constraints

3. **Execute Operation**
   - Build command with appropriate flags
   - Use `--params` for query/path parameters
   - Use `--json` for request body
   - Handle pagination with `--max-results` or `--page-token`

4. **Error Handling**
