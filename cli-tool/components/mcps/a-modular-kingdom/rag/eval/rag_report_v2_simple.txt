Query: What can be inferred from the passage about seed-producing plants?
Ground Truth: Some of them have turned seed predation into an action that benefits them.

  the seed is not scarified,the seedling embryo is sealed in,never to germinate.Many plants,however,have turned seed predation into a mechanism for seed dispersal,such as the transport and caching of seeds by squirrels,jays,mice,and ants.

  browsing by vertebrate herbivores,as well as hard-coated seeds.These structures may have evolved early in the history of the plants,when they might have been subject to even greater predatory pressures.Because they represent little investment,plants still retain them.

  --- Chunk 3 ---
  Many seeds have thick,hard seed coats that provide protection from seed- eating animals.The problem with such seed defense is that the seeds need to be scarified-the hard seed needs scratching or scoring of the seed coat to weaken it-so the seedling itself can escape.If the seed is not scarified,the seedling embryo is sealed in,never to

  Admittedly,it is easy to underestimate the value of material elicited by oral historians who investigate preliterate societies.Professional poets and singers may faithfully record the same lay or the same genealogical table for many generations,for their memory is beyond question.Nevertheless,oral tradition is always subject to change.The Lunda

  Some historians,therefore,try to supplement their sources with information from indigenous traditions and folklore,heroic legends,genealogical tables,and personal reminiscences.The use of oral history,however,again presents many difficulties.Historians can look at the same document again and again;so can their successors.An artifact can be

Query: What's the reason white dwarfs have been observed and black dwarfs have not?
Ground Truth: white dwarfs emit light and black dwarfs do not

  --- Chunk 1 ---
  White dwarfs are extremely small stars with densities greater than any known terrestrial material.It is believed that white dwarfs began life as low-mass or medium-mass stars.As the star ages,it begins to collapse-become a "dwarf-because it no longer produces sufficient radiant heat to counteract the contracting force of its gravity.Although some

  A study of white dwarts produced what might at first appear to be a surprising conclusion:the smallest white dwarfs are the most massive,and the largest white dwarfs are the least massive.The explanation for this is that a more massive star has a greater gravitational force,and that greater gravitational force contracts the star into a

--- Query ID: q5 ---
Query: Among stars that eventually became white dwarfs, why do the largest and most massive stars produce the smallest white dwarfs?
Ground Truth: The gravitational force collapsing a star is greater for more massive stars;so the greater mass is compressed into a smaller volume.

Query: Why are neutron stars very difficult to locate visually?
Ground Truth: their small size restricts the amount of light they radiate

  --- Chunk 1 ---
  Although neutron stars have high surface temperatures,their small size would greatly limit their luminosity.Consequently,locating one visually would be extremely difficult.However,theory predicts that a neutron star would have a very strong magnetic field.Further,as a star collapses,it will rotate faster,for the same reason ice-skaters rotate

  How can astronomers find an object whose gravitational field prevents the escape of all matter and energy?Theory predicts that as matter is pulled into a black hole,it should become very hot and emit a flood of x-rays before being engulfed.The first black hole x-ray sources were discovered in 1971 by detectors on satellites.
