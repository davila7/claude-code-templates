  seed predation into a mechanism for seed dispersal,such as the transport and caching of seeds by squirrels,jays,mice,and ants.

  --- Chunk 2 ---
  Many seeds have thick,hard seed coats that provide protection from seed- eating animals.The problem with such seed defense is that the seeds need to be scarified-the hard seed needs scratching or scoring of the seed coat to weaken it-so the seedling itself can escape.If the seed is not scarified,the seedling embryo is sealed in,never to germinate.Many plants,however,have turned seed predation into a mechanism for seed dispersal,such as the transport and caching of seeds by

  . These include tough leaves,spines,and epidermal hairs on leaves,which may trap,impale,or fence out insects and discourage browsing by vertebrate herbivores,as well as hard-coated seeds.These structures may have evolved early in the history of the plants,when they might have been subject to even greater predatory pressures.Because they represent little investment,plants still retain them.

  . But-unlike the authors of so many biographies-they hardly ever wrote in order to deceive posterity;hence,archival evidence has an unusual degree of authenticity.The lack of such material makes the historian's job hard indeed.For where there is no writing,there are large areas of human behavior that cannot be described accurately except by speculative extrapolations from literate cultures or by conjectures determined to a large extent by our own cultural preconceptions.

  Admittedly,it is easy to underestimate the value of material elicited by oral historians who investigate preliterate societies.Professional poets and singers may faithfully record the same lay or the same genealogical table for many generations,for their memory is beyond question.Nevertheless,oral tradition is always subject to change.The Lunda people,who dwell on the Luapula River, are,for instance,very interested in their own past.But as lan Cunnison,a British anthropologist,observes,"this is

  Some historians,therefore,try to supplement their sources with information from indigenous traditions and folklore,heroic legends,genealogical tables,and personal reminiscences.The use of oral history,however,again presents many difficulties.Historians can look at the same document again and again;so can their successors.An artifact can be preserved in a museum,and different conclusions can be arrived at by going over the same evidence again and again

  . Worse still,we cannot draw on administrative archives.Dull as they look, administrative files have a peculiar value denied to other written records.They are composed of documents drawn up or used in the course of an administrative or executive transaction of which they had formed a part.This does not necessarily make official memorandums,communiques,and such more reliable, for officials often enough were dishonest with their inferiors and superiors alike

  --- Chunk 2 ---
  A study of white dwarts produced what might at first appear to be a surprising conclusion:the smallest white dwarfs are the most massive,and the largest white dwarfs are the least massive.The explanation for this is that a more massive star has a greater gravitational force,and that greater gravitational force contracts the star into a smaller,more densely packed object than one gets with a less massive star.Thus,the smallest white dwarfs came from the collapse of stars that were larger and

  White dwarfs are extremely small stars with densities greater than any known terrestrial material.It is believed that white dwarfs began life as low-mass or medium-mass stars.As the star ages,it begins to collapse-become a "dwarf-because it no longer produces sufficient radiant heat to counteract the contracting force of its gravity.Although some white dwarfs are no larger than Earth,the mass of such a dwarf can equal 1.4 times that of the Sun.A spoonful of such matter would weigh several

  of such a dwarf can equal 1.4 times that of the Sun.A spoonful of such matter would weigh several tons.As a star contracts into a white dwarf, its surface becomes very hot and very bright.But,without a continuing source of energy,it will slowly become cooler and dimmer.Although none have been observed,the terminal stage of a white dwarf must be a small,cold, nonluminous body called a black dwarf.

--- Query ID: q5 ---
Query: Among stars that eventually became white dwarfs, why do the largest and most massive stars produce the smallest white dwarfs?
Ground Truth: The gravitational force collapsing a star is greater for more massive stars;so the greater mass is compressed into a smaller volume.

Query: Why are neutron stars very difficult to locate visually?
Ground Truth: their small size restricts the amount of light they radiate
Precision: 1
--- Retrieved Chunks ---
  --- Chunk 1 ---
  Although neutron stars have high surface temperatures,their small size would greatly limit their luminosity.Consequently,locating one visually would be extremely difficult.However,theory predicts that a neutron star would have a very strong magnetic field.Further,as a star collapses,it will rotate faster,for the same reason ice-skaters rotate faster as they pull in their arms.If the Sun were to collapse to the size of a neutron star,it would increase its rate of rotation from once every 25 days

  In the early 1970s,a source that radiates short pulses of radio energy,called a pulsar (pulsating radio source),was discovered in the Crab Nebula.Visual inspection of this radio source revealed it to be a small star centered in the nebula.The first neutron star had been discovered.Are neutron stars made of the densest matter possible?No.During a supernova event,remnants of stars greater than three solar masses apparently collapse into objects even smaller and denser than neutron stars.Even

  to the size of a neutron star,it would increase its rate of rotation from once every 25 days to nearly 1,000 times per second.The radio waves generated by such rotating stars would be concentrated into two narrow beams, like the rotating light on a police car or ambulance.If Earth happened to be in the path of this beacon,the star would appear to blink on and off,or pulsate,as the radio waves swept past.

  How can astronomers find an object whose gravitational field prevents the escape of all matter and energy?Theory predicts that as matter is pulled into a black hole,it should become very hot and emit a flood of x-rays before being engulfed.The first black hole x-ray sources were discovered in 1971 by detectors on satellites.
