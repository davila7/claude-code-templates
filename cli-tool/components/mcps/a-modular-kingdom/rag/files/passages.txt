How Effective Are Structural Plant Defenses?
Some of the least costly defenses,in terms of energy use,available to plants are structures that make penetration by predators difficult,if not impossible. These include tough leaves,spines,and epidermal hairs on leaves,which may trap,impale,or fence out insects and discourage browsing by vertebrate herbivores,as well as hard-coated seeds.These structures may have evolved early in the history of the plants,when they might have been subject to even greater predatory pressures.Because they represent little investment,plants still retain them.
Many seeds have thick,hard seed coats that provide protection from seed- eating animals.The problem with such seed defense is that the seeds need to be scarified-the hard seed needs scratching or scoring of the seed coat to weaken it-so the seedling itself can escape.If the seed is not scarified,the seedling embryo is sealed in,never to germinate.Many plants,however,have turned seed predation into a mechanism for seed dispersal,such as the transport and caching of seeds by squirrels,jays,mice,and ants.

The role of structural defenses in plants was largely presumed until experimental evidence was sought to demonstrate the effectiveness of such apparent defensive structures against grazing herbivores.Researchers investigated experimentally the effects of plant spinescence on the feeding habits of three large browsing mammalian herbivores of Africa.These were the kudu,a large African antelope attaining a female body weight of 180 kilograms; the impala,a medium-sized African antelope attaining a female body weight of 50 kg;and the Boer goat,a domestic ungulate weighing about 35 kg.The experimenters hand reared the antelope from calves to allow observation of feeding habits from very close range,1 to 5 meters,under natural conditions,to determine biting rates the animals employed.They converted the bites to dry biomass by collecting samples of leaves and shoots of a size similar to those eaten and drying them to a constant weight.They calculated eating rate as the product of bite size (dry mass)and biting rate.

Another one of their experiments involved a detailed study to examine the influence of spinescence.They selected ten plants each of five species of trees at a height accessible to impalas outside the enclosure.The woody plants exhibited three basic types of spinescence:paired prickles or thorns situated in or close to the leaf axils;short,sharp-tipped branchlets or spines,sometimes carrying small leaves;and prickles of various kinds on leaves.Thorns were either straight and long,up to 70 millimeters,or short and sharply curved (hooked).On each tree,two branches were matched for size,shape,density of leaf cover,and ease of access to impalas.These paired branches were labeled and the thorns were removed from one of the branches in each pair. Two months later,researchers visually estimated the relative loss of foliage from browsing.

Results clearly showed that thorns and spines affected the feeding behavior of the three ungulates.These structures restricted bite sizes to mostly single leaves or leaf clusters,and hooked thorns retarded biting rates.Acceptability of leaves of those plant species offering small leaf size along with prickles was lower,at least for kudu,than those of other palatable plant species.The inhibitory effect of prickles was greater for impalas and goats than for kudu, which bit off the shoot ends in spite of the prickles.For certain straight-thorned species,kudu compensated partially for their slow eating rates by spending more time gathering the leaves.Most spinescent species were similar to unarmed palatable species in their acceptability to the ungulates,even though the armed species had a higher crude protein to their foliage.Probably these spinescent species,especially species of Acacia 
plants,would be preferred over unarmed species but for the thorns.

The main effect of these armed structural defense features is to restrict bite size,thus increasing handling time.Thorns,spines,and prickles restrict foliage losses to large herbivores.In addition,the animals may incur scar tissue in the esophagus and scratches in the mouth and throat.These experiments show that at least in some cases structural plant defenses are effective at protecting plants.


Writing History
Historians throughout the ages have been beset by many pitfalls in their attempts to write history.Modern historians writing the history of Africa not only face problems similar to those experienced by their colleagues writing the history of other cultures.Most medieval African societies south of the Sahara lacked an alphabet and a written language.African written languages were confined mainly to Ethiopia,to Sudan,and to the maritime cities of the east coast.Early Greek, Roman,Amharic,Fulani,and Swahili texts still survive to give us some idea of bygone days.Future collectors will almost certainly find additional records when they search for documents in North Africa and in faraway countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia.In tropical countries,however,old papers are preserved only with great difficulty,for white ants and atmospheric humidity pose serious problems even to modern archivists.Early record keepers were even less equal to their task,and much material has been lost or destroyed.

The lack of written material means that we shall never be able to read,for example,the memoirs of a king of the Luba people in the eighteenth century. Worse still,we cannot draw on administrative archives.Dull as they look, administrative files have a peculiar value denied to other written records.They are composed of documents drawn up or used in the course of an administrative or executive transaction of which they had formed a part.This does not necessarily make official memorandums,communiques,and such more reliable, for officials often enough were dishonest with their inferiors and superiors alike. But-unlike the authors of so many biographies-they hardly ever wrote in order to deceive posterity;hence,archival evidence has an unusual degree of authenticity.The lack of such material makes the historian's job hard indeed.For where there is no writing,there are large areas of human behavior that cannot be described accurately except by speculative extrapolations from literate cultures or by conjectures determined to a large extent by our own cultural preconceptions.

Some historians,therefore,try to supplement their sources with information from indigenous traditions and folklore,heroic legends,genealogical tables,and personal reminiscences.The use of oral history,however,again presents many difficulties.Historians can look at the same document again and again;so can their successors.An artifact can be preserved in a museum,and different conclusions can be arrived at by going over the same evidence again and again. But two or three people cannot interview the same informant twice;even should they do so,they will not necessarily elicit the same information,for the interviewers themselves help impose a subjective pattern on the information they obtain.Human witnesses,moreover,will remember previous interviews;their memory can never be erased like a magnetic tape in such a way that they can be questioned over and over again without changing their answers at least to some degree.

Admittedly,it is easy to underestimate the value of material elicited by oral historians who investigate preliterate societies.Professional poets and singers may faithfully record the same lay or the same genealogical table for many generations,for their memory is beyond question.Nevertheless,oral tradition is always subject to change.The Lunda people,who dwell on the Luapula River, are,for instance,very interested in their own past.But as lan Cunnison,a British anthropologist,observes,"this is not history as we know it.It is the handing on of what is already known or believed,and it does not involve the asking of questions about the past,and the search for the answer to them."

This does not mean that oral traditions are without value to historians.They enlarge their imagination,they help them pose new questions,and they tell them a great deal concerning a people's culture;they also provide a substratum of fact.They are,however,difficult to interpret,and the conventional historian's intellectual tools may often prove inadequate for the task.Oral traditions, moreover,like all other forms of evidence,always stand in need of corroboration and can never be accepted on the basis of their own authority.


Stellar Remnants
Eventually,all stars consume their nuclear fuel and collapse into one of three final states-white dwarf,neutron star,or black hole.

White dwarfs are extremely small stars with densities greater than any known terrestrial material.It is believed that white dwarfs began life as low-mass or medium-mass stars.As the star ages,it begins to collapse-become a "dwarf-because it no longer produces sufficient radiant heat to counteract the contracting force of its gravity.Although some white dwarfs are no larger than Earth,the mass of such a dwarf can equal 1.4 times that of the Sun.A spoonful of such matter would weigh several tons.As a star contracts into a white dwarf, its surface becomes very hot and very bright.But,without a continuing source of energy,it will slowly become cooler and dimmer.Although none have been observed,the terminal stage of a white dwarf must be a small,cold, nonluminous body called a black dwarf.

A study of white dwarts produced what might at first appear to be a surprising conclusion:the smallest white dwarfs are the most massive,and the largest white dwarfs are the least massive.The explanation for this is that a more massive star has a greater gravitational force,and that greater gravitational force contracts the star into a smaller,more densely packed object than one gets with a less massive star.Thus,the smallest white dwarfs came from the collapse of stars that were larger and more massive than those the large white dwarfs came from.

Extending this idea of larger stars collapsing to smaller stars leads to the prediction that very large stars would collapse to stars even smaller and more massive than white dwarfs.Named neutron stars,these objects are thought to be the remnants of supernova events (the collapse of a large,very massive star).If Earth were to collapse to the density of a neutron star,it would have a diameter equivalent to the length of a football field,and a pea-sized sample of this matter would weigh 100 million tons.This is approximately the density of an atomic nucleus;thus,neutron stars can be thought of as large atomic nuclei.

Although neutron stars have high surface temperatures,their small size would greatly limit their luminosity.Consequently,locating one visually would be extremely difficult.However,theory predicts that a neutron star would have a very strong magnetic field.Further,as a star collapses,it will rotate faster,for the same reason ice-skaters rotate faster as they pull in their arms.If the Sun were to collapse to the size of a neutron star,it would increase its rate of rotation from once every 25 days to nearly 1,000 times per second.The radio waves generated by such rotating stars would be concentrated into two narrow beams, like the rotating light on a police car or ambulance.If Earth happened to be in the path of this beacon,the star would appear to blink on and off,or pulsate,as the radio waves swept past.

In the early 1970s,a source that radiates short pulses of radio energy,called a pulsar (pulsating radio source),was discovered in the Crab Nebula.Visual inspection of this radio source revealed it to be a small star centered in the nebula.The first neutron star had been discovered.Are neutron stars made of the densest matter possible?No.During a supernova event,remnants of stars greater than three solar masses apparently collapse into objects even smaller and denser than neutron stars.Even though these objects would be very hot, their gravity would be so immense that even light could not escape the surface. Consequently,they would literally disappear from sight.These incredible bodies have appropriately been named "black holes.Anything that moved too near a black hole would be swept in by its irresistible gravity and annihilated.

How can astronomers find an object whose gravitational field prevents the escape of all matter and energy?Theory predicts that as matter is pulled into a black hole,it should become very hot and emit a flood of x-rays before being engulfed.The first black hole x-ray sources were discovered in 1971 by detectors on satellites.
