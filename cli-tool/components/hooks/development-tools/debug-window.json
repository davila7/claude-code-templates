  "description": "Auto Debug Log Viewer. Opens a live-tailing debug log window when Claude Code starts with --debug or -d flag. The window closes automatically on session end. To keep the debug window open after the session ends, set the DEBUG_WINDOW_AUTO_CLOSE_DISABLE=1 environment variable in the env property of your settings.json. Supports macOS, Linux, and Windows (Git Bash/Cygwin). If you encounter any issues, please report them at https://github.com/davila7/claude-code-templates/issues",
