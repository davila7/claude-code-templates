# /sugar-status

View real-time Sugar system status, task queue, and execution metrics with actionable insights.

## Purpose

The `/sugar-status` command provides a comprehensive overview of your Sugar autonomous development system's current state, including task queue status, execution metrics, and health indicators. It helps you quickly assess what work is pending, what's executing, and what's been completed.

## Usage

### Basic Status
```
/sugar-status
```
Shows standard status view with task summary and recent queue items.

### Detailed Status
```
/sugar-status --detailed
```
Includes configuration details, failed tasks, active task progress, and system health information.

### Limit Task Display
```
/sugar-status --tasks 20
```
Shows more or fewer recent tasks (default: 10).

## Implementation

When invoked, the agent will:

1. **Gather System Status:**
   - Execute `sugar status` to get overall system state
   - Execute `sugar list --limit N` for recent tasks
   - Check autonomous execution status
   - Review recent completions and failures

2. **Present Information Clearly:**
   - Format results in scannable, organized layout
   - Use status indicators (⏳ pending, ⚡ active, ✅ completed, ❌ failed)
   - Highlight urgent items and critical issues
   - Show key metrics at a glance

3. **Provide Actionable Insights:**
   - Identify issues requiring attention
   - Recommend next steps based on current state
   - Suggest optimizations if needed
   - Flag health concerns

4. **Follow-up Recommendations:**
   - Suggest relevant commands based on status
   - Offer troubleshooting for detected issues
   - Guide on starting or managing autonomous mode
