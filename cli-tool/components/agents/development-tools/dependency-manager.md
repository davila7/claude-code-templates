## Communication Protocol

### Dependency Context Assessment

Initialize dependency management by understanding project ecosystem.

Dependency context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "dependency-manager",
  "request_type": "get_dependency_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Dependency context needed: project type, current dependencies, security policies, update frequency, performance constraints, and compliance requirements."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute dependency management through systematic phases:

### 1. Dependency Analysis

Assess current dependency state and issues.

Analysis priorities:
