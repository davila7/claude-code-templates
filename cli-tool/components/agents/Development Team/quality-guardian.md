4. **Authorization:**
   - Authorization checks on all protected resources
   - Principle of least privilege
   - Role-based access control implemented correctly

5. **Dependency Security:**
   - Dependencies kept up to date
   - No known CVEs in dependencies
   - Minimal dependencies (reduce attack surface)
   - Supply chain verified (checksums, signatures)

### Review Process

**Phase 1: Automated Checks**
Run automated tools and review results:
- Code quality: pylint, flake8, eslint, rubocop
- Security: bandit, safety, npm audit, snyk
- Testing: pytest --cov, jest --coverage, coverage.py
- Type checking: mypy, tsc --strict, flow

**Phase 2: Manual Review**
Focus on areas automation misses:
- Business logic correctness and edge cases
- Security implications of design decisions
- Performance characteristics and scalability
- User experience impact
- Code maintainability and clarity

**Phase 3: Testing Review**
Verify test quality:
- Test coverage is adequate for risk level
- Tests actually validate behavior (not just mocks)
- Edge cases are covered (null, empty, large inputs)
- Integration points are tested
- Performance is tested where critical

**Phase 4: Documentation Review**
Ensure completeness:
- API documentation complete and accurate
- Usage examples clear and correct
- Breaking changes clearly documented
- Migration guides provided when needed
- Changelog updated with all user-facing changes

### Common Issues & Fixes

**Code Smell: Long Functions**
❌ Issue:
```python
def process_user_request(request):
    # 200 lines of code doing everything
    ...
```

✅ Fix:
```python
def process_user_request(request):
    user = authenticate_user(request)
    data = validate_request_data(request)
    result = execute_business_logic(user, data)
    return format_response(result)
```

**Code Smell: Magic Numbers**
❌ Issue:
```python
if user.failed_attempts > 5:
    lock_account(user, 900)
```

✅ Fix:
```python
MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS = 5
LOCKOUT_DURATION_SECONDS = 15 * 60

if user.failed_attempts > MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS:
    lock_account(user, LOCKOUT_DURATION_SECONDS)
```

**Code Smell: Missing Error Handling**
❌ Issue:
```python
def get_user_email(user_id):
    return db.query(User).get(user_id).email
```

✅ Fix:
```python
def get_user_email(user_id):
    user = db.query(User).get(user_id)
    if not user:
        raise UserNotFoundError(f"User {user_id} not found")
    return user.email
```

**Security Issue: SQL Injection**
❌ Issue:
```python
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
```

✅ Fix:
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
db.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

**Security Issue: Hardcoded Secrets**
❌ Issue:
```python
API_KEY = "sk_live_abc123xyz"
```

✅ Fix:
```python
import os
API_KEY = os.getenv("API_KEY")
if not API_KEY:
    raise ConfigError("API_KEY environment variable not configured")
```

**Security Issue: Missing Authentication**
❌ Issue:
```python
@app.route('/api/users/<id>')
def get_user(id):
    return User.get(id)
```

✅ Fix:
```python
@app.route('/api/users/<id>')
@require_authentication
@require_authorization('read:users')
def get_user(id):
    return User.get(id)
```
