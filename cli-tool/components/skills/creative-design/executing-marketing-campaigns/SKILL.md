## Core Principles

### Key Marketing Terminology (Consistent Throughout)
- **Campaign**: A coordinated set of marketing activities with unified messaging around a specific goal
- **Channels**: Distribution platforms (email, social media, paid ads, blog, etc.)
- **Target Audience**: Specific demographic/psychographic segments the campaign addresses
- **Engagement Rate**: Percentage of audience who interact with content
- **Conversion**: A desired action (signup, purchase, demo request, etc.)
- **CTR (Click-Through Rate)**: Percentage of impressions that result in clicks
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**: Total marketing spend divided by new customers acquired

### Workflow: Campaign Development & Execution

When developing a marketing campaign, follow this structured approach:

1. **Define Objectives**
   - What business goal does this campaign support? (lead generation, brand awareness, product launch, retention)
   - What is the target conversion or engagement metric?
   - What's the timeline?

2. **Identify Target Audience**
   - Who are we reaching?
   - What are their pain points and motivations?
   - Where do they spend time online?

3. **Develop Campaign Strategy**
   - Core message/value proposition
   - Channel mix (which channels reach this audience best?)
   - Content themes and messaging pillars
   - Competitive positioning

4. **Create Campaign Assets**
   - Refine messaging for each channel
   - Create copy, visuals, and interactive elements
   - Ensure brand consistency (see [brand.md](reference/brand.md))
   - Develop email sequences, social posts, landing pages as needed

5. **Plan Campaign Execution**
   - Timeline and launch date
   - Channel-specific scheduling
   - Responsible team members
   - Budget allocation

6. **Set Up Measurement**
   - Define success metrics and KPIs
   - Establish baseline/benchmark
   - Plan reporting cadence
   - Identify monitoring tools

7. **Launch & Monitor**
   - Execute across channels
   - Track performance daily
   - Make real-time optimizations
   - Document learnings

8. **Analyze & Report**
   - Compare results to targets
   - Calculate ROI and campaign efficiency
   - Document what worked/what didn't
   - Recommend improvements for future campaigns

### Decision Framework: Channel Selection

**High Urgency + Broad Audience** → Paid advertising, email (existing list)
**Long Sales Cycle + Technical Audience** → Content marketing, LinkedIn
**Quick Feedback Needed** → Social media, paid social testing
**Build Thought Leadership** → Blog, webinars, case studies
**Direct Customer Outreach** → Email sequences, sales outreach
**Awareness + Engagement** → Social media, community building

## Common Challenges & Solutions

**Problem**: Campaign messaging isn't resonating
**Solution**: Review target audience definition, test different value propositions in paid ads first, analyze engagement data for what topics generate interest

**Problem**: Low email open rates
**Solution**: Test subject lines, adjust send times, verify email list quality is high, improve sender reputation

**Problem**: Can't isolate campaign impact
**Solution**: Use UTM parameters consistently, maintain separate landing pages per campaign, ensure analytics tracking is configured

**Problem**: Budget wasted on wrong channels
**Solution**: Start with channel audit showing where target audience is, begin with paid testing on multiple channels, allocate budget based on performance data

## Collaboration Tips

- **With Product Team**: Share competitive positioning and customer feedback from campaigns
- **With Sales Team**: Provide campaign context and lead scoring criteria
- **With Design Team**: Brief them on brand guidelines and campaign visual direction
- **With Analytics Team**: Define metrics upfront, request custom dashboards
