**Basic Formula**:
```
ROI = (Revenue from campaign - Campaign cost) / Campaign cost × 100%
```

**Example**:
- Campaign cost: $5,000
- Generated leads: 50
- Conversion rate to customer: 20% (10 customers)
- Average contract value: $3,000
- Revenue: 10 × $3,000 = $30,000
- ROI = ($30,000 - $5,000) / $5,000 × 100% = 500%

**Attribution Note**: Use UTM parameters or campaign-specific landing pages to accurately track revenue attribution.
