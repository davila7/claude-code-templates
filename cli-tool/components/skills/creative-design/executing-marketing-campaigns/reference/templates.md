## Form Best Practices

### Optimal Form Fields

**"Too many fields" is the #1 reason forms aren't submitted**

**Short form (high conversion, basic info)**:
- Email
- Company name
- [One domain-specific field]
[Submit button]

**Medium form (lead qualification)**:
- Email
- Company name
- Job title
- Company size
- Current challenge [dropdown]
[Submit button]

**Long form (detailed qualification)**:
- Email
- Company name
- Job title
- Company size
- Industry
- Annual budget
- Timeline
- Specific need
[Submit button]

### Form Field Best Practices

- Mark required fields clearly
- Don't ask for phone number unless critical
- Use dropdown for "company size" not free text
- Ask conditional questions (show based on previous answer)
- Progressive profiling: save some questions for email follow-up
- Include helpful placeholder text but not as label
- Large button text size (18+ px)
- Show progress if form is long ("Step 1 of 3")

### Post-Submission

- Show thank you message with next steps
- Send confirmation email immediately
- Deliver promised content within email
- Set expectation for follow-up ("You'll hear from us in 24 hours")
