- [ ] Test that Claude can access all files
- [ ] Confirm skill appears in available skills list

**Team Onboarding**

- [ ] Document any customizations you made

### Phase 5: Optimization (After Initial Use)

**Monitor Usage**
- [ ] Track which parts of the skill are used most
- [ ] Note any confusion or questions from team
- [ ] Collect feedback on missing information
- [ ] Track time saved vs. previous approach

**Iterative Improvements**

- [ ] Improve unclear sections
- [ ] Add new templates based on common needs

**Knowledge Capture**
- [ ] Document successful infrastructure patterns discovered
- [ ] Add new modules as they're created
- [ ] Update with actual performance data

## Common Customization Updates

### Update 1: Cloud Provider Configuration
**Files**: reference/terraform.md, reference/cloud_platforms.md

Replace generic cloud provider examples with your specific configuration:

```hcl
# Your organization's Terraform backend configuration
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "your-company-terraform-state"
    key            = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "your-company-terraform-lock"
  }
}
```

### Update 2: Kubernetes Cluster Configuration
**File**: reference/kubernetes.md

Add your organization's cluster configuration:

```yaml
# Your organization's namespace structure
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: production
  labels:
    environment: production
    team: platform
    cost-center: engineering
```

### Update 3: CI/CD Pipeline Standards
**File**: reference/cicd.md, examples/pipelines/

Update with your CI/CD platform and standards:

```yaml
# Your organization's pipeline template
name: Standard Deploy Pipeline
# Include your specific stages, approval gates, etc.
```

### Update 4: Tagging Strategy
**File**: reference/terraform.md

Replace generic tags with your organization's required tags:

```hcl
locals {
  common_tags = {
    Environment   = var.environment
    Project       = var.project_name
    ManagedBy     = "Terraform"
    CostCenter    = var.cost_center
    Owner         = var.owner_email
    Compliance    = var.compliance_level
    DataClass     = var.data_classification
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

**Issue**: Files not loading
**Solution**: Verify file paths use forward slashes and are relative to SKILL.md location

**Issue**: Links between files broken
**Solution**: Check that all links use proper markdown format: `[text](path/to/file.md)`

**Issue**: Skill not appearing
**Solution**: Verify SKILL.md frontmatter has exactly `name` and `description` fields

**Issue**: Python script not executing
**Solution**: Verify script has execute permissions and Python 3 is available in environment

```bash
chmod +x scripts/devops_utils.py
python3 --version  # Should be 3.8 or higher
```

**Issue**: Terraform examples don't work
**Solution**: Update provider versions and check AWS credentials configuration

**Issue**: Kubernetes manifests fail validation
**Solution**: Check apiVersion compatibility with your cluster version
